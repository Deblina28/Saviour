# Saviour
A safety system with SOS signaling, morse code converter and GPS tracking for your next trip to a less visited location

## Inspiration
The countless stories and movies like the Lord of the Flies, Robinson Crusoe, Titanic, Cast Away, Six Days Seven Nights, etc. where the protagonist gets stuck on an island, even though it sounds very adventurous, but nonetheless the dangerous probability of it happening in real to people still remains. The idea behind Saviour was to create a hack that allows people to travel to remote locations without having to worry about getting lost or getting stuck there. 

## What it does
Sometimes we see that people only send the SOS signal using radio, but Saviour sends the location details i.e. the latitude and longitude of the signal's origin location using the GPS. This will make it a lot easier for the search party to find the lost individual and speed up the process of rescuing them. 
This hack is not only a very important tool that will come in handy for people going on a vacation or traveling because of work purposes but it can also be used as an educational tool for learning morse code. 

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were in a bit of a time crunch since a lot had to be done, but we decided to work on one aspect at a time and finish that first. We are really proud to have overcome all the challenges and bring a mere project idea into life and that too in very little time. Saviour is a hack that we are very proud of building this tool because it can really help people in times of emergency.
